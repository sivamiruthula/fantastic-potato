    <h2>Passionate about learning and exploring new technologies.</h2>

    <p>
        I am a twenty-year-old student at VIT, currently pursuing my second year in B.Tech in Computer Science. Born and raised in Tiruppur, a district in Tamil Nadu, I am always eager to learn new things and explore the world of technology. <span class="highlight">Technology</span> is my passion, and I believe it holds the key to solving many of the challenges we face today. My journey has just begun, and I’m excited to see where it will take me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of academics, I am passionate about sports and love playing <span class="highlight">basketball</span>. I’ve been playing basketball since the 5th grade, and it has taught me valuable lessons in teamwork and perseverance. My involvement in athletics goes beyond basketball, as I have also participated in long jump, relay events, and marathons. <span class="highlight">Sport</span> is not just a hobby but a way of life for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I’m not studying or playing sports, I like to unwind by watching <span class="highlight">Netflix</span> series and playing video games. It helps me relax and stay connected with my friends. While I also enjoy other activities, I’ve learned that <span class="highlight">sewing</span> is not my strength, and I prefer focusing on things I love. I believe in pursuing my passions and continuously improving myself.
